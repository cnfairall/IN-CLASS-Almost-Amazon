## About the User
- The ideal user for this application is an online bookstore owner.
- They want to create, read, update and delete books and authors in their inventory.
- This app solves the problem of keeping track of what products are available in their store.

## Features 
- User-specific: The user logs in with their google account and sees all the books they've created in their inventory.
- Create a book: User clicks "add a book" button to open a form. After the user inputs the book information, submitting the form creates a book object on the database and the books page re-renders to show the updated collection.
- Authors: The user can view all the authors they've created.
- Create an author: User clicks "add an author" button on "Authors" page to open a form. Submitting the form creates an author object on the database and the authors page re-renders to show the updated collection. Authors do not need a book to be created.
- Filter: The user can view only books that are on sale, and only favorite authors.
- View: The user can view a details page for each individual book and author.
- Update: User can edit books and authors.
- Delete: The user can delete specific books and authors. When the user deletes an author, all of the author's books are also deleted.
- Search: The user can search books by title.
